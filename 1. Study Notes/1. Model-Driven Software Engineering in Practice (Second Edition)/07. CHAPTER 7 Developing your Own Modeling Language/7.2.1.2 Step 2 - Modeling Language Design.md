#### Step 2: Modeling Language Design

First, concepts are transformed into classes, intrinsic properties into attributes, and extrinsic properties are defined as associations between classes. This initial structure allows reasoning about further modeling constraints. Attributes require types like String, Integer, and Boolean. If there’s a range of possible values, enumerations may be defined. For the association ends, upper and lower bounds of multiplicities must be set properly.

Furthermore, one must reason about the containment structure of the metamodel, as elements in models are often nested. For instance, the content layer contains classes, which contain attributes. This structure must be defined in the metamodel by declaring association ends as compositions. The most significant consequence is that deleting the container element deletes all of its contained elements.

To improve readability and extendability, inheritance relationships between classes reuse attributes and associations (e.g., abstract classes for pages and links). Refactorings on metamodels can improve class diagram structure. Shifting attributes from subclasses to superclasses, extracting superclasses from existing classes, or substituting associations with explicit classes to define additional properties are recurring operations. Metamodels should fulfill object-oriented modeling quality attributes.

<font style="color: #006ec7 ">Discourse.</font>  &emsp; For defining a modeling concept, metamodeling languages offer three options: classes, attributes, or associations. When choosing a representation, consider the advantages and disadvantages of each. This decision significantly impacts the modeling possibilities and user experience. User feedback can help improve the language by switching between patterns.

If a more powerful content modeling language is needed, import existing metamodels, like the class diagram part of the UML metamodel, instead of remodeling the language from scratch.

<font style="color: #006ec7 ">Modeling constraints. </font>  &emsp; Several constraints cannot be defined by current metamodeling languages only in terms of graphical elements. Therefore, OCL defines additional constraints as well-formedness rules. These rules are implemented as additional invariants for metamodel classes and must hold for every model. Thus, constraints are defined on the metamodel and validated on the model level.

Introducing OCL invariants for metamodel classes precisely defines a modeling language, leading to higher-quality models, especially important for code generation. Otherwise, problems may go undetected until the final implementation, manifesting as compile-time or runtime errors, or remain undetected in the worst case.

OCL invariants can define well-formedness rules, modeling guidelines, and best practices, including naming conventions.
