#### Step 1: Modeling Domain Analysis

Several sources of information can be exploited to find appropriate modeling concepts. The choice of sources depends on the purpose of the modeling language. For abstracting from low-level program code, existing programs can be a major source of information. Recurring patterns in the code can be abstracted to modeling concepts. For a specific domain, document analysis or expert interviews may be appropriate. These activities should lead to concrete reference examples for communication with domain experts, testing the language and code generators, etc.

It primarily introduces modeling concepts by defining their properties, which is crucial for developing the abstract syntax. Sometimes, other aspects, like notation and semantics, are also discussed. To build the first version of the metamodel, the essence of the abstract syntax must be filtered out, resulting in a list of concepts and their properties.
