### 7.2.1 METAMODEL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

One way to conceptualize a metamodel is to view it as the schema that stores its models within a repository. Consequently, developing a metamodel is akin to creating a class diagram for a concrete domain. The initial step involves identifying the concepts that should be supported by the language. Subsequently, these concepts must be concisely specified using a metamodeling language. Once the first metamodel version is ready, generic editors can be employed to test the modeling language. These editors facilitate the interpretation of the metamodel, enabling the construction of example models. By utilizing these editors to model reference examples, a preliminary assessment can be made to determine if all concepts have been adequately defined or if any modifications to the metamodel are necessary. In essence, the metamodeling process, in its most basic form, comprises a three-step, iterative, and incremental process.

* **Step 1: Modeling domain analysis**: Three aspects must be considered in developing a modeling language: *purpose*, *realization*, and *content*. The most challenging aspect is identifying modeling concepts and their properties. To do this, analyze the modeling domain and find reference examples that should be expressible in the language. These examples define the language’s requirements.

* **Step 2: Modeling language design**: A metamodeling language formalizes identified modeling concepts by modeling its abstract syntax and constraints using OCL. This step yields a metamodel for developing the language.

* **Step 3: Modeling language validation**: The metamodel is instantiated by modeling reference examples to validate its completeness and correctness. Other language design principles like simplicity, consistency, scalability, and readability must also be considered. This step provides valuable feedback for the next metamodel development iteration.

This process currently focuses on developing the abstract syntax of the language. To get domain expert feedback, a concrete syntax is also needed for an accessible modeling language. In practice, the complete process should involve developing both the abstract and concrete syntax. However, we discuss them sequentially in this book for didactic reasons, but strongly encourage developing both syntactical concerns together in practice.

To make the metamodel development process more concrete, it’s now being used to develop a metamodel for a DSML.
