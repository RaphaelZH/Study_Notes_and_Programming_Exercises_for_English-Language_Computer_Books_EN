# CHAPTER 7 Developing your Own Modeling Language

Modeling is often misunderstood as just drawing pretty pictures. However, models follow a clearly defined structure, similar to program code, conforming to the associated *metamodel* representing the modeling language’s *abstract syntax*. This well-defined structure enables various operations, such as loading/storing models, querying, transforming, and checking well-formedness. In some modeling environments and tools, metamodels are hidden behind the user interface, making them invisible to modelers. Designers may not need a clear understanding of these aspects in simple scenarios, but it’s crucial for complex MDE design, especially when building tailored environments. Developing and using a metamodel is crucial because other language aspects, like visual notation, are heavily based on them.
