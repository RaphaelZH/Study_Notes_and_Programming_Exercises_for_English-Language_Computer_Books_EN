### 5.5.2 TEST-DRIVEN MODELING

When software is derived from models, testing the code is unnecessary (assuming complete code generation and trust in the code generator). Instead, test the models. Some test-driven development approaches for modeling artifacts follow this philosophy: before developing a model excerpt, write the model test to evaluate new functionality at the modeling level. Model the new functionality and execute the test to ensure model correctness. This practice requires executable models (see Chapter 3). Chapter 10 discusses tools for exhaustive and systematic model testing and validation.
