## 5.5 TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT AND MDSE

Test-driven development (TDD) follows the test-first philosophy, where developers write executable test cases to check new functionality. If a test fails, the developer writes the code to pass it, effectively forcing implementation. Once the code passes the full test suite, it’s refactored, and the process repeats.

MDSE can be integrated into TDD at two levels: when models are used for code generation to automatically derive system implementation, and when they aren’t.

> * **TDD Process**: Write a test, write code to pass the test, refactor the code, and repeat.
> 
> * **MDSE Integration**: MDSE can be integrated into TDD when models are used for code generation or not.
