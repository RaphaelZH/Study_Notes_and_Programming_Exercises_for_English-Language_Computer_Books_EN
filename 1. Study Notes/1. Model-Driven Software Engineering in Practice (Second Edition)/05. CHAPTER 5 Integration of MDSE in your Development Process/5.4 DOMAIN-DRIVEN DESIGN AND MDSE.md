## 5.4 DOMAIN-DRIVEN DESIGN AND MDSE

Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software development approach based on two main principles:

1. Focus on the domain and not technical details.

2. Use a model for complex domain designs.

DDD emphasizes an appropriate and effective representation of the system-to-be’s problem domain. It provides design practices and techniques for software developers and domain experts to share and represent their domain knowledge using models.

DDD shares aspects with MDSE, arguing for using models to represent domain knowledge and focusing on platform-independent aspects during development. MDSE provides techniques for modeling, creating DSLs, and more to implement DDD.

MDSE complements DDD (Figure 5.1) by enhancing developer benefits from domain models. Model transformation and code generation techniques allow domain models to represent the domain (structure, rules, dynamics) and generate the actual software system to manage it.
