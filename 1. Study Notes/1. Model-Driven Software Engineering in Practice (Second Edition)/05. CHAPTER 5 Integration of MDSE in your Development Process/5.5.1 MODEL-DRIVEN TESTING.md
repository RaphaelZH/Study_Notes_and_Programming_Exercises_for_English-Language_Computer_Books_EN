### 5.5.1 MODEL-DRIVEN TESTING

Models can be used to derive tests for system implementations to ensure they behave as expected. This is known as model-based testing. As shown in Figure 5.2, a test generation strategy is applied at the model level to derive a set of tests, which are then translated into executable tests for the system’s technological platform. Testing strategies depend on the model and test type. For instance, constraint solvers generate test cases for static models, while model checkers generate relevant execution traces for dynamic models.
