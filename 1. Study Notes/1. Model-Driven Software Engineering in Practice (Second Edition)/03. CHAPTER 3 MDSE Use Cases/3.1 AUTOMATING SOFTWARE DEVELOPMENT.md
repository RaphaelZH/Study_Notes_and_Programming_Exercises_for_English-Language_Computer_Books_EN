## 3.1 AUTOMATING SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

Software development automation starts with a high-level representation of desired software features and gradually transforms it into a functional application. This process may involve user interaction during generation.

Following an MDSE approach, the running application can be obtained through model transformations that progressively refine the software description until an executable version is reached. Figure 3.2 illustrates an MDSE-based development process. In each phase, models are (semi)-automatically generated using model-to-model transformations, utilizing models from the previous phase (and manually completing or refining when necessary). In the final step, the final code is generated through a model-to-text transformation from the design models.

Introducing MDSE into the development process offers several advantages. It bridges the communication gap between requirements/analysis and implementation by capturing and organizing the system’s understanding. This facilitates discussions among team members and integrates new ones. MDE increases communication effectiveness between stakeholders and the productivity of the development team due to (partial) automation. It also reduces the number of defects in the final code inadvertently introduced by developers.

To generate a running system from models, they must be executable. An executable model is complete enough to be executed. Theoretically, a model is executable when its operational semantics are fully specified. In practice, the excitability of a model may depend more on the execution engine than on the model itself. Some models may not be entirely specified but can be executed by advanced tools that fill in the gaps. Conversely, complex and complete models may not be executable due to the absence of an appropriate execution engine.

*Executable UML*, a well-known family of executable models, uses an action language (imperative pseudocode) to precisely define the behavior of class methods, state transitions, etc. The OMG has standardized executable UML models, including a Foundational Subset for Executable UML Models (fUML) that models software specifications suitable for automated software development. The adopted *Action Language for fUML*, Alf, is a textual notation for UML behaviors attached to UML models at fUML behavior locations. Syntactically, Alf resembles typical C/C++/Java legacy languages, easing learning.

Code generation and model interpretation are two alternative strategies to “implement” execution tools and make executable models execute.
