## 8.3 ENDOGENOUS, IN-PLACE TRANSFORMATIONS

Models were manually modified in modeling editors by adding, removing, or updating elements. However, many scenarios require automated modifications. Out-place transformations require building the output model from scratch, copying the source model, and deleting or modifying elements. In-place transformations provide changes without copying static elements, requiring only transformation rules for dynamic changes.

*Graph transformation* is an elegant approach to in-place model transformations. It’s selected for demonstrating their development and usage.

<font style="color: #006ec7 ">Graph Transformation Basics.</font> &emsp; Graph transformation is a declarative, rule-based technique for expressing in-place model transformations. Models and meta-models can be expressed as graphs with typed, attributed nodes and edges, allowing for model manipulation using graph transformation techniques.

Graph transformations are useful for defining in-place transformations, supporting model simulation, optimization, execution, evolution, and refactoring. However, they are so general that out-place transformations could be formulated by representing the source, target, and trace models as one integrated graph.

Graph transformations are popular due to their visual form (intuition) and formal nature (analysis). They can describe the operational semantics of modeling languages for implementing model execution engines. This allows the use of the abstract and sometimes concrete syntax of the language to define the transformation rules, making them intuitive to designers.

A *graph grammar* consists of transformation rules and an initial graph (*host graph*) to which the rules apply. A rule has a left-hand side (LHS) graph expressing pre-conditions and a right-hand side (RHS) graph containing post-conditions. The actions of the rule are implicitly defined by both sides. Execution of a transformation rule produces the following effects: (i) all elements in the LHS are deleted; (ii) all elements in the RHS are added; and (iii) all elements in both sides are preserved. To mark equivalence between elements in the LHS and RHS, they must have the same identifier.

To apply a rule to the initial graph, a *morphism* (also called *occurrence* or *match*) of the LHS must be found in it. If multiple matches are found, one is selected randomly. The rule is then applied to the selected match by substituting it with the RHS. The grammar execution proceeds by applying the rules in non-deterministic order until none are applicable. Other graph transformation systems provide more control over the transformation execution. More details are presented later.

Graph transformation rules can be applied fully automatically by the graph transformation engine in arbitrary order. However, some cases require an interactive execution mode. For example, if a refactoring needs to be applied to a specific model element, the user must select the element as an input parameter for the transformation rule. Some graph transformation approaches allow for pre-bound LHS elements by providing explicit user input before executing transformation rules. Additionally, some approaches allow users to provide additional input during transformation execution, such as setting values for features of model elements that cannot be derived from the current model state.

<font style="color: #006ec7 ">Advanced graph transformations techniques.</font> &emsp; Several advanced techniques exist for specifying, executing, and analyzing graph transformations.

**Alternative notations.** Transformation rules have been defined in the abstract syntax of the modeling language. Using the concrete syntax may improve readability, but only a few graph transformation tools provide this capability. Some approaches use a condensed graphical notation by merging NACs, LHS, and RHS into one graph with annotations for forbidden, preserved, deleted, or created elements. Others use a textual concrete syntax to define the rules. We discuss these approaches in the end of this section.

**Rule scheduling.** A graph transformation system consists of rules. The order in which they’re executed is non-deterministic until no rule matches. This can lead to multiple output models. However, a deterministic execution is preferred. Two extensions support this. First, define *priorities* for rules. If multiple rules match, the highest/lowest priority rule is executed. Second, use programming-like control structures, called graph transformation units, to *orchestrate* rules. These structures allow for loops, conditional branches, and so on. These approaches are called *programmable graph transformations*.

**Analysis.** Graph transformations, a declarative approach based on a strong theoretical basis, offer several analysis methods. For non-deterministic systems, determining if the same unique model is produced regardless of rule order is crucial. Critical pairs, mutually exclusive rules that hinder or enable each other’s application, can be computed. Additionally, some approaches allow reasoning about the termination of graph transformation systems.

<font style="color: #006ec7 ">Tool Support.</font> &emsp; Several Eclipse projects focus on providing graph transformation technologies for EMF. These projects support diverse features for implementing and executing graph transformations. Thus, the choice of graph transformation tool depends on the specific transformation problem.

&emsp; **Henshin**, successor to EMF Tiger, introduces advanced features like programmable graph transformations and model checking support. It also integrates with AG, enabling advanced graph transformation techniques like computing critical pairs between transformation rules.

&emsp; **Fujaba**, a protagonist of programmable graph transformation approaches, orchestrates graph transformation rules using story diagrams (similar to UML activity diagrams). Java is used to define application conditions for the LHS and assignments for the RHS within these rules.

&emsp; **e-Motions**, an Eclipse plugin, uses graph transformation rules to graphically specify the behavior of modeling languages. It allows specifying time-related attributes for rules, such as duration or periodicity. Once the behavior of a modeling language is defined in e-Motions, models can be simulated and analyzed by translating them and the transformation to Maude, a programming framework based on rewriting logic.

&emsp; ** ATL Refining.** *ATL Refining* adds a new execution mode for in-place transformations. Activate it by replacing the *from* keyword with *refining* in an ATL transformation header. In-place transformation rules are syntactically like out-place rules, but their execution differs. If an output pattern element shares a variable name with an input pattern element, it’s updated by bindings but not created. New output pattern elements (without input counterparts) are generated by the rule. An output pattern element can be annotated with *drop* to delete it and all its contained elements. ATL Refining is an in-place transformation language with a textual syntax.
