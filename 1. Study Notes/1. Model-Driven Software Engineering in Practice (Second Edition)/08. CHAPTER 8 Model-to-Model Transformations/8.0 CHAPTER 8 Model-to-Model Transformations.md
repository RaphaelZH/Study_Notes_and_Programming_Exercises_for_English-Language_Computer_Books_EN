# CHAPTER 8 Model-to-Model Transformations

Models are dynamic entities that undergo various processes during an MDE process. These processes include *merging*, *aligning*, *refactoring*, *refining*, and *translating* models.

All these model operations are implemented as model transformations, either Model-to-Model (M2M) or Model-to-Text (M2T) transformations (the latter is the topic of the next chapter). In M2M, the input and output are models; in M2T, the output is a text string. Text-to-Model (T2M) transformations have a text string as input and a model as output; they’re typically applied in reverse engineering (cf. Chapter 3).

Many efforts have been spent designing specialized languages for specifying M2M transformations, ranging from textual to visual, declarative to imperative, and semi-formal to formal, in the last decade. We review most of them in the next sections and focus on two protagonists to illustrate their main characteristics.

> * Model transformations, implemented as Model-to-Model (M2M) or Model-to-Text (M2T), convert models to models or text strings, respectively. Text-to-Model (T2M) transformations, used in reverse engineering, convert text strings to models.
