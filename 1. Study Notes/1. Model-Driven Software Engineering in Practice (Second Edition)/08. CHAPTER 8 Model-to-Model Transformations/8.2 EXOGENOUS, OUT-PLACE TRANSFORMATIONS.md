## 8.2 EXOGENOUS, OUT-PLACE TRANSFORMATIONS

ATLAS Transformation Language (ATL) is the illustrative transformation language for developing exogenous, out-place transformations. It’s widely used in academia and industry, with mature tool support. ATL is a rule-based language that builds on OCL but provides dedicated features for model transformations missing in OCL, like creating model elements.

ATL, a hybrid model transformation language, combines declarative and imperative constructs. It’s *uni-directional*, requiring two transformations for language A to B and vice versa. ATL transformations operate on *read-only* source models and produce *write-only* target models. For out-place transformations, we use *source model* for *input model* and *target model* for *output model*.

During ATL transformations, source models are queried but not modified. Target model elements are created but not queried directly. These restrictions ensure that query results from source and target models remain consistent regardless of the transformation’s execution state, which contradicts the declarative nature of ATL.

<font style="color: #006ec7 ">Anatomy of ATL transformations.</font> &emsp; An ATL transformation is represented as a *module* with a *header* and a *body* section. The header section specifies the module name and declares the source and target models, which are typed by their metamodels. ATL transformations can have multiple input and output models.

The ATL transformation body consists of *rules* and *helpers* stated in arbitrary order after the header section.

* **Rules**: Each rule describes how a part of the target model should be generated from a part of the source model. ATL has two kinds of declarative rules: *matched* rules and *lazy* rules. Matched rules are automatically matched by the ATL execution engine, while lazy rules require explicit calling from another rule, giving the transformation developer more control over the execution.

	Rules consist of *input* and *output* patterns. The input pattern filters source model elements relevant to the rule by defining input pattern elements. Each input pattern element requires an obligatory type (corresponding to a metaclass in the source metamodel) and an optional filter condition (expressed as an OCL expression). These constraints determine the applicable model elements. The output pattern details how the target model elements are created from the input. Each output pattern element can have multiple *bindings* to initialize the features of the target model elements. Binding values are calculated by OCL expressions.

* **Helpers**: A helper is an auxiliary function that enables the possibility of factoring ATL code used in different points of the transformation. There are two types of helpers: one simulates a derived attribute that needs to be accessible throughout the transformation, and the other represents an operation that calculates a value for a given context object and input parameters. Unlike rules, helpers cannot produce target model elements; they can only return values that are further processed within rules.

<font style="color: #006ec7 ">Execution phases of ATL transformations.</font> &emsp; ATL, a powerful language, allows us to define transformations concisely. To understand its syntax, let’s examine the actual transformation execution by the ATL virtual machine. ATL transformations are executed in three sequential phases.

**Phase 1: Module initialization.** In the first phase, the *trace model* for storing *trace links* between source and target elements is initialized. In phase 2, each matched rule execution creates a trace link pointing to the matched input and output elements. The trace model is crucial for exogenous transformations: (i) stopping transformations and (ii) assigning target element features based on source element values.

**Phase 2: Target elements allocation.** In the second phase, the ATL transformation engine finds valid configurations of source model elements that match the source pattern of the matched rules. When a matched rule’s condition is fulfilled by a configuration, the engine allocates the corresponding target model elements based on the declared target pattern elements. Only the elements are created, not their features. Each match creates a trace link connecting the matched source elements to the generated target elements.

**Phase 3: Target elements initialization.** In the third phase, each allocated target model element is initialized by executing the bindings defined for the target pattern element. These bindings often invoke the *resolveTemp* operation, which allows references to any target model elements generated in the second execution phase for a given source model element. The resolveTemp operation has the signature `resolveTemp(srcObj: OclAny, targetPatternElementVar: String)`. The first parameter represents the source model element for which target elements need to be resolved, while the second parameter is the variable name of the target pattern element to retrieve. This parameter is required because multiple target pattern elements can be used in a rule to generate multiple target elements for a single source element.

<font style="color: #006ec7 ">Internal vs. external trace models.</font> &emsp; The internal trace model of the ATL transformation engine enables convenient setting of target element features and stopping rule execution. Rules are only executed if the matched input elements are not covered by an existing trace link.

If external traceability requires a persistent trace model, e.g., to see the impact of source model changes on the target model, the internal trace model (defaultly transient) may be persisted as a separate output model of the transformation.

<font style="color: #006ec7 ">Alternatives to ATL.</font> &emsp; Besides ATL, there are other dedicated transformation approaches for exogenous, out-of-place transformations.

&emsp; **QVT.** The OMG’s Query-View-Transformation (QVT) standard supports three languages for model transformation development: QVT Relational, QVT Operational, and QVT Core. QVT Relational defines bi-directional correspondences between metamodels, enabling the derivation of transformations in both directions and consistency checks. QVT Operational is an imperative language for uni-directional transformations with out-of-the-box tracing support, but transformation rule dispatching requires user definition, similar to lazy rules in ATL. QVT Core is a low-level language designed for the QVT Relational compiler, not for direct transformation writing. Eclipse provides tool support for QVT Relations, QVT Core, and QVT Operational languages.

&emsp; **TGG.** Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs) define a correspondence graph between two metamodels, enabling bidirectional model transformations. They synchronize models and check consistency. Similar to QVT Relations, TGGs offer a strong theoretical basis. MOFLON and Eclipse support TGGs through the TGG Interpreter and the TGG tool at MDElab.

&emsp; **ETL.** The Epsilon project developed several languages for model management. The Epsilon Transformation Language (ETL) supports out-of-place model transformations similar to ATL, but it also offers features like modifying input model elements during transformations.
