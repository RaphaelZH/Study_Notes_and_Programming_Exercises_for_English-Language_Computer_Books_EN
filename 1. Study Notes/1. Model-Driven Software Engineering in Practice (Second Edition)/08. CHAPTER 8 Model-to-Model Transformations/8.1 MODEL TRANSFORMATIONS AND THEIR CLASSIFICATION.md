## 8.1 MODEL TRANSFORMATIONS AND THEIR CLASSIFICATION

Transformations are a key software engineering technique since the introduction of high-level programming languages compiled to assembler. Model transformations are equally crucial in MDE and come in various flavors to address different tasks.

An M2M transformation is a program that takes one or more models as input and produces one or more models as output. *One-to-one* transformations are usually sufficient, but *one-to-many*, *many-to-one*, or *many-to-many* transformations may be required, for example, in a model merge scenario to unify multiple class diagrams.

Besides classifying model transformations based on input and output models, another dimension is whether the transformation is between models from different languages (*exogenous*) or within the same language (*endogenous*). An example of an exogenous transformation is transforming a platform-independent model (e.g., a UML model) to a platform-specific model (e.g., a Java model). An example of an endogenous transformation is model refactoring, which involves restructuring models to improve quality.

Exogenous model transformations are useful for both *vertical* and *horizontal* transformations. Vertical transformations change the abstraction level of the input and output models, as seen in the UML to Java scenario. Horizontal transformations change the abstraction level of the input and output models, but they remain similar. For example, horizontal transformations are used for model exchange between modeling tools, such as translating a UML class diagram to an ER diagram.

Two central execution paradigms for model transformations emerged in the last decade, as compared in Figure 8.1. First, *out-place* transformations *generate* the output model from scratch (Figure 8.1a), suitable for exogenous transformations. Second, *in-place* transformations *rewrite* the model by creating, deleting, and updating elements in the input model (Figure 8.1b), perfect for endogenous transformations like refactorings.

![Figure 8.1: Different kinds of model transformations: (a) exogenous out-place vs. (b) endogenous in-place.](../08.%20CHAPTER%208%20Model-to-Model%20Transformations/Figures/Figure%208.1.png)

We present how to specify *exogenous* transformations as *out-place* transformations using ATL and *endogenous* transformations as *in-place* transformations using graph transformation languages.
