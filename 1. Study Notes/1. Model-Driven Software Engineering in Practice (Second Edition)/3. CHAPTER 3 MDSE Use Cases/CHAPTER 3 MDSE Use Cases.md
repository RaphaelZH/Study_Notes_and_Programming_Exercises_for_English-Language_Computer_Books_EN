MDSE’s most prominent application is *software development automation*, or model-driven development (MDD). MDD automates as much of the software lifecycle as possible, from requirements to deployment. However, MDSE’s potential applications extend far beyond this scope. MDD is merely a part of the MDSE iceberg (Figure 3.1). In this context, MD(S)E can be interpreted as *Model-Driven Everything*, implying that the MDSE approach can be applied to any software engineering task.
