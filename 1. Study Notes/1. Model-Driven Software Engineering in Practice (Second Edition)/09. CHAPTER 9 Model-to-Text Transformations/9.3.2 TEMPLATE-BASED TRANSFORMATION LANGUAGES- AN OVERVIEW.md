### 9.3.2 TEMPLATE-BASED TRANSFORMATION LANGUAGES: AN OVERVIEW

Various template-based languages can be used to generate text from models.

* **XSLT**: The XMI serializations of the models can be processed with XSLT, the W3C standard for transforming XML documents into arbitrary text documents. However, the code generation scripts require implementing based on the XMI serialization, which necessitates knowledge of how models are encoded as XML files. Therefore, approaches directly operating on the model level are more favorable.

* **JET**: The Java Emitter Template (JET) project was one of the first approaches for developing code generation for EMF-based models. JET is not limited to EMF-based models. It transforms every Java-based object to text. JET provides a JSP-like syntax for writing templates for M2T transformations. Arbitrary Java expressions can be embedded in JET templates. JET templates are transformed to pure Java code for execution. However, JET lacks a dedicated query language for models.

* **Xtend**: Xtend, a modern programming language, is mainly based on Java but offers additional features. It supports code generation with template expressions and functional programming, which is beneficial for querying models (many OCL iterator-based operations are available out-of-the-box).

* **MOFScript**: This project offers another M2T transformation language with features similar to Xtend. MOFScript, a candidate proposal for the OMG standardization effort, provides a standardized language for M2T transformations. It’s available as an Eclipse plug-in and supports EMF-based models.

* **Acceleo**: This project aims to provide a practical version of the OMG’s M2T transformation standard for EMF-based models. It supports full OCL querying and has mature tool support, useful in industry.
