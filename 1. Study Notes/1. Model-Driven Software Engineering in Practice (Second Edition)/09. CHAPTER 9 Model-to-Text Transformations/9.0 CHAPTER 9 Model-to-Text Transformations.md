# CHAPTER 9 Model-to-Text Transformations

Several concepts, languages, and tools have been proposed in the last decade to automate text derivation from models using Model-to-Text (M2T) transformations. These transformations have been used to automate software engineering tasks like generating documentation and task lists.

M2T transformations are primarily used for code generation, which is the main goal of model-driven software engineering. Current execution platforms are mostly code-based, with a few exceptions that allow direct model interpretation. M2T transformations focus on generating code to transition from the model level to the code level. Not only system code can be derived from models, but also other code-related artifacts like test cases and deployment scripts. Formal code descriptions can also be derived for analyzing system properties. Models offer both constructive derivation of the system and analytical exploration or verification of system properties, making them a valuable tool for both construction and analysis. M2T transformations serve as the bridge between execution platforms and analysis tools.

This chapter introduces model-based code generation using M2T transformations, discusses various approaches to implementing them, and provides techniques for mastering code generator complexity.
