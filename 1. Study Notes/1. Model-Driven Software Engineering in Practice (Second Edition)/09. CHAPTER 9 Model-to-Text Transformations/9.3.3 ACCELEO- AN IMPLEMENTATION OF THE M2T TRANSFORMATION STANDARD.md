### 9.3.3 ACCELEO: AN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE M2T TRANSFORMATION STANDARD

Acceleo is selected as a protagonist to demonstrate M2T language transformation due to its practical relevance and mature tool support. Other M2T transformation languages like Xtend and MOFScript also support Acceleo’s language features.

Acceleo offers a template-based language for defining code generation templates. It supports OCL and additional operations for working with text-based documents, including advanced string manipulation functions. Acceleo includes powerful tooling such as an editor with syntax highlighting, error detection, code completion, refactoring, debugger, profiler, and a traceability API for model element tracing to generated code and vice versa.

Before defining templates in Acceleo, a container module is created to hold them. This module imports the metamodel definition for the templates, making them aware of the metamodel classes that can be used as template types. Templates in Acceleo are always defined for a specific metamodel class. In addition to the model element type, a pre-condition can be defined, similar to a filter condition in ATL, to apply a template only to model elements with a specific type and values.

The Acceleo template language has several meta-markers, called tags in Acceleo, that are also common in other M2T transformation languages.

* **Files**: To generate code, files must be opened, filled, and closed, as in the Java-based code generator. In Acceleo, a special `file` tag prints the content between its start and end. The tag’s path and file name are defined by its attributes.

* **Control Structures**: There are tags for defining control structures like loops (`for` iterating over collections of elements) and conditional branches (`if`).

* **Queries**: OCL queries, similar to ATL helpers, can be defined with a `query` tag. They can be called throughout the template to factor out recurring code.

* **Expressions**: Expressions are used to compute values for the dynamic parts of the output text. They can also call other templates to include their generated code in the caller template’s code. Calling other templates is similar to method calls in Java.

* **Protected Areas**: M2T languages support projects with partial code generation. Special protection is needed to safeguard manually added code from file modifications in subsequent generator runs. Acceleo’s protected tag supports protected areas, which mark sections in generated code that shouldn’t be overridden again. These sections usually contain manually written code.
