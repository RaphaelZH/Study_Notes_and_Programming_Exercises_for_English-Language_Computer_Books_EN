### 9.4 MASTERING CODE GENERATION

To address the complexity of model-based code generators, several advanced techniques are briefly described below.

&emsp; **Abstracting templates.** Abstracting code generation templates from concrete reference examples is a proven approach to ensure that generated code is accepted by developers, especially when only partial code generation is applied. Acceleo offers the possibility to refactor a concrete reference example to a template, with several refactoring operations to substitute example code with tags. For instance, a concrete Java class name can be refactored to an expression that queries the name value from a model element. This tool support allows for systematic extraction of templates from example code, ensuring developers are familiar with the produced output.

&emsp; **Reusing templates.** Current M2T transformation languages offer features for structuring and reusing transformation logic. Templates can be nested in an inheritance tree, enabling polymorphic template calls based on model element type. This is useful in metamodels where inheritance is used to reuse features. Templates can be reused and extended for subclasses defined for superclasses to avoid duplicated code. M2T languages also support aspects for defining and weaving cross-cutting concerns to code generators or refining complete transformation modules by overriding templates instead of extending them by inheritance.

&emsp; **Step-by-step generation.** Dividing a code generation process into several steps by chaining transformations is useful when there’s a significant gap between the model and code levels. This leads to verbose templates that hide the final output structure. Applying the divide-and-conquer principle with transformation chains (cf. Section 8.4) results in more readable, reusable, and maintainable components. For instance, if a code generator for flat state machines exists, an M2M transformation from nested state machines to flat state machines can be provided for reuse.

&emsp; **Separating transformation logic from text.** Refactor complex computations, such as queries on the input model or complex String computations, into queries or libraries that can be imported in templates when needed. This makes the final output structure more visible in templates and previous code reusable in other templates or code generators.

&emsp; **Mastering code layout.** The code layout is determined by the template. It can be challenging to produce the desired layout when several loops and conditions are in the template. Xtend allows us to have a code beautifier as a postprocessing unit for the code generator output. Besides using a code beautifier, there are language features in M2T languages that control the actual layout of the output, such as operators for ignoring line breaks in templates and special signs produced in loops.

&emsp; **Be aware of model/code synchronizing problems.** Protected areas are helpful for partial code generation, but manually added code may not be placed correctly in the next generator run. Especially when using class-method names as protected area IDs, renaming refactorings on the class and method on the model level makes synchronization impossible. Such refactorings result in a new Java file with a « new » operation, requiring manual copying, addition, and adaptation of the implementation code. Some M2T transformation frameworks, like Acceleo, report if manually added code cannot be merged with the new code. In such cases, the code generator’s log file summarizes the unintegrated lines of code.

Be cautious when refactoring a model with partial code generation. One approach is to execute model-level refactorings and corresponding code-level refactorings, then run the code generator after propagation. Another approach is to use immutable internal IDs of model elements for protected area IDs. The former approach requires more effort to build model/code synchronization support, but it can automatically adapt manually added code to the new model version. The latter approach doesn’t require additional effort.
