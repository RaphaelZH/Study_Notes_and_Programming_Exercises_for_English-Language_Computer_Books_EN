### 9.3.1 BENEFITS OF M2T TRANSFORMATION LANGUAGES

A Java-based code generator was presented in the previous section to illustrate how necessary features must be implemented in GPLs. M2T transformation languages aim to improve code generator development by addressing the drawbacks of GPL-based code generators.

<font style="color: #006ec7 ">Separated static/dynamic code.</font> &emsp; M2T transformation languages separate static and dynamic code using a *template*-based approach. Templates define static text elements shared by all artifacts and dynamic parts filled with case-specific information. Templates contain simple text fragments for the static part and *meta-markers* for the dynamic part. Meta-markers are placeholders interpreted by a *template engine* that processes templates and queries additional data sources (models) to produce dynamic parts. Figure 9.2 summarizes template-based text generation.

<font style="color: #006ec7 ">Explicit output structure.</font> &emsp; Templates explicitly represent the structure of output text by embedding code for dynamic parts in the static part, reversing the previous Java-based code generator. This mechanism, similar to Java Server Pages (JSPs), allows explicit representation of HTML page structures and embedded Java code, unlike Java Servlets. Explicitly represented output structures lead to more readable and understandable code generation specifications than using String variables. Templates also ease code generator development. For instance, developers can create templates by adding example code and substituting dynamic parts with meta-markers (i) simplifying the abstraction process from concrete code examples to template specifications and (ii) templates have a similar structure and format as the code to be produced, enabling traceability of template effects to the code level.

<font style="color: #006ec7 ">Declarative query language.</font> &emsp; We need to access information stored in models within meta-markers. As presented, OCL is the choice for most M2M transformation languages. Current M2T transformation languages also allow us to use OCL (or a dialect of OCL) for specifying meta-markers. Template languages not tailored to models but supporting various sources use standard programming languages like Java for specifying meta-markers.

<font style="color: #006ec7 ">Reusable base functionality.</font> &emsp; Current M2T transformation languages provide tool support for reading models and serializing text into files using configuration files. This eliminates the need for manual redefinition of model loading and text serialization.
