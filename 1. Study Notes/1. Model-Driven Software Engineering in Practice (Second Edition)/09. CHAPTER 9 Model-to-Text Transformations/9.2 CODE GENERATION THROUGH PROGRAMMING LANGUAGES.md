## 9.2 CODE GENERATION THROUGH PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

A code generator can be implemented based on MDE principles or a traditional programming approach. In the latter case, it’s a program that uses the model API generated from the metamodel to process input models and print code statements to a file using standard stream writers provided by the programming language’s APIs.

The model API is implemented in EMF using an M2T transformation that reads an Ecore-based metamodel and generates a Java class for each Ecore class. The Ecore-to-Java mapping is straightforward, a design goal of Ecore. For each metaclass feature, corresponding getter and setter methods are generated on the Java side. This allows reading, modifying, and creating a model from scratch using generated Java code instead of modeling editors. For more information on using the generated model APIs and the powerful EMF API, refer to the interested reader.

Before discussing specific M2T transformation languages in Section 9.3, we show how a GPL can be used to develop a code generator. This demonstrates: (i) processing models using a model API generated from the metamodel and (ii) features needed for a code generator.

The following phases must be supported by a code generator, as illustrated in Figure 9.1.

1. **Load models**: Models must be deserialized from their XMI representation to an in-memory object graph. Current metamodeling framework APIs offer specific operations for this.

2. **Produce code**: Use the model API to process models and collect the necessary model information for generating code. Typically, the object graph is traversed from the root element of a model to its leaf elements.

3. **Write code**: Code is saved in String variables and persisted to files via streams.

This approach requires no additional programming skills. It suffices to know the chosen programming language and the model API. No additional tools are needed for design or runtime. However, it has drawbacks.

* **Intermingled static/dynamic code:** *Static code*, generated for every model element, and *dynamic code* derived from model information, such as class and variable names, are not separated.

* **Non-graspable output structure:** The code generator specification doesn’t clearly show the output structure. The generated code is embedded in the producing code, so the control structure is explicit but the output format isn’t. This issue is also seen in other GPL-based generator approaches, like Java Servlets1 for producing HTML code with embedded statements.

* **Missing declarative query language:** No declarative query language exists for accessing model information. This leads to unnecessary code from iterators, loops, conditions, and type casts. Also, knowledge of the generated model API is required. For instance, getter methods must be used to access model element features instead of querying feature values using metamodel names.

* **Missing reusable base functionality:** Code must be developed to read input models and persist output code repeatedly for each code generator.

DSLs, developed to eliminate disadvantages, generate text from models. This led to the OMG standard *MOF Model to Text Transformation Language* (MOFM2T). We show how a Java-based code generator can be re-implemented in a dedicated M2T transformation language and discuss its benefits.
