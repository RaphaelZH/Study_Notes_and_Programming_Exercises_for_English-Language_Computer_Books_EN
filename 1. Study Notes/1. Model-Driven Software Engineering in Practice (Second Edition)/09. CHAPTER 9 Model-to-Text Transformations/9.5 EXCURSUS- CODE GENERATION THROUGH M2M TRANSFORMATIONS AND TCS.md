### 9.5 EXCURSUS: CODE GENERATION THROUGH M2M TRANSFORMATIONS AND TCS

If the target language of an M2T transformation is supported by a metamodel and a TCS, we can use an M2M transformation instead. Figure 9.3 illustrates the resulting process. First, we transform the metamodel of the modeling language to the metamodel of the text-based language. Then, we serialize the target model into text using the mapping between the abstract syntax and the TCS.

This approach seems beneficial: (i) Reusing the textual concrete syntax definition ensures valid textual artifacts; (ii) An explicit metamodel for the text-based language allows better reasoning about language concepts and mappings; (iii) Transformation definitions can be validated based on the metamodels; (iv) Output models representing text-based artifacts can be validated against the target metamodel; and (v) Changes in the target language’s concrete syntax are independent of the transformation, so no additional code generator maintenance is needed.

However, this approach has limitations. Most available metamodels for programming languages lack TCS definitions or are incomplete. Text-based languages are known only by their TCS, making reasoning on abstract syntax concepts time-consuming, unlike code generation templates. Copying and substituting code with meta-markers doesn’t support abstraction from reference code to transformation definitions, unlike M2T transformations. Partial code generation features like protected areas are not covered. For code generators, only a restricted part of the target language is needed, which is easier to implement with M2T transformations without reasoning on the complete language definition.

From a pragmatic viewpoint, it’s easier to start with building a code generator using M2T transformation languages, especially when no metamodel and TCS definitions for the target language exist. The M2M/TCS approach for code generation should only be considered when the target language is supported by a metamodel, TCS, and a full code generation approach.
