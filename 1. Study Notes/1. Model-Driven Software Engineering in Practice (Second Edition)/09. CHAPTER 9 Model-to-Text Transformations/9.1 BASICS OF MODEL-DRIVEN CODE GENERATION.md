## 9.1 BASICS OF MODEL-DRIVEN CODE GENERATION

Code generation has a long history in software engineering, dating back to the early days of high-level programming languages. However, compilers and MDE have different goals for code generation. In compilers, code generation transforms source code into machine code. In MDE, it transforms models into source code. MDE code generation relies on existing compilers for programming languages.

Three essential questions for developing a model-based code generator are:

* **How much is generated?** The main question is which parts of the code can be automatically generated from models. Is *full* or *partial* code generation possible? Partial can mean one layer of the application is completely generated while another is manually developed, or one layer is partially generated with missing parts requiring manual completion. Partial code generation may also refer to the model level, where code generation is used for certain parts while others are manually implemented.

* **What is generated?** It’s crucial to determine the source code to generate. The code should be concise, and it should be readable by developers, as emphasized in Chapter 3’s Turing test for code generators. Therefore, exploit current high-level programming languages, APIs, and frameworks to avoid reinventing the wheel. Choose the right programming paradigm to minimize code generation and system representation.

* **How to generate?** Once the requirements for code generation are specified, including which parts are generated and which target languages are used, it’s decided *how* to implement these requirements. Several languages, from GPLs to DSLs, can be used to generate code from models.

Code generation is the vertical transition from higher-level models to lower-level artifacts. MDE benefits heavily from this transition, so code generators must bridge this abstraction gap in various ways.

<font style="color: #006ec7 ">Closing the gap between models and code.</font> &emsp; When a modeling language is used to build models, not all underlying technologies may be expressible. MDE aims to abstract from technology details. For instance, if defining a UML class diagram for a domain, you may need to introduce attributes of type String. If deploying the diagram in a space-limited environment, you may define a restricted length for these attributes instead of the maximum possible String length. As in the MDA approach, additional information may be needed to achieve executable software.

Information can be provided by the modeler using model augmentations, the convention-over-configuration principle for code generation, or leaving the specification open on the model level and filling details at the code level. The first approach allows tweaking details for the derived implementation, requiring more effort in preparing models. The second approach doesn’t need this effort but optimizations may only be done on the code level. A hybrid approach combines convention-over-configuration with manual tweaking by model augmentations. Using the third approach, only partial implementations are generated, requiring developers to complete them on the code level. Special care must be taken, as models and code contradict the single source of information principle. Countermeasures include protected areas in the code requiring manual code or explicit extension points. Base classes can be generated and extended by user-defined classes for missing functionality that can’t be specified on the model level.
