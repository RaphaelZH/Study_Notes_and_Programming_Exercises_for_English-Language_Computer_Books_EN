## 6.2 MULTI-VIEW MODELING AND LANGUAGE EXTENSIBILITY

In software engineering, you typically model orthogonal system aspects using different modeling languages or a multi-viewpoint modeling language with various diagram types.

System aspects are classified into *static* (or *structural)* and dynamic aspects. Static aspects describe the main ingredients and their relations, while *dynamic* aspects describe their behavior in terms of actions, events, and interactions. Separating static and dynamic aspects is usually a good practice.

Furthermore, languages often include extensibility mechanisms that allow designers to expand coverage by defining new modeling elements. This is common in GPLs, which often need specialization for specific domains or problems. This can lead to a well-known domain-specific language from general-purpose ones.

UML, a general-purpose language proposed by OMG within the MDA framework, comprises various diagrams for system description and extension mechanisms. Several extensions have become standard languages like SysML and SoaML. Thus, UML can be considered a family of languages in three senses: it allows enough variability to be considered a group of languages, pairs with correlated languages like OCL to enhance its expressive power, and is accompanied by domain-specific profiles.
