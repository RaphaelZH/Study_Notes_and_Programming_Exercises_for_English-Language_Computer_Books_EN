## 6.2 MULTI-VIEW MODELING AND LANGUAGE EXTENSIBILITY

In software engineering, you typically model orthogonal system aspects using different modeling languages or a multi-viewpoint modeling language with various diagram types.

System aspects are classified into *static (or structural)* and dynamic aspects. Static aspects describe the main ingredients and their relations, while *dynamic* aspects describe their behavior in terms of actions, events, and interactions. Separating static and dynamic aspects is usually a good practice.

Languages often include extensibility mechanisms that allow designers to define new modeling elements, which is common in GPLs that need specialization for specific domains or problems. This can lead to domain-specific languages developed from general-purpose ones.

A well-known example is UML, the GPL proposed by OMG within the MDA framework. UML is a general-purpose language with various diagrams and extension mechanisms. Several extensions have become standard languages, such as SysML and SoaML. Therefore, UML can be seen as a *family of languages (or language suite)* in three senses: as a whole with enough variability to be considered a group of languages, paired with correlated languages like OCL that improve its expressive power, and accompanied by domain-specific profiles defined around it.
