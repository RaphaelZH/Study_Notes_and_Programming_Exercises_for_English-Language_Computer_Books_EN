### 6.5.4 UML PROFILING

*UML profiles* are packages of related and coherent extensibility elements defined with the above techniques. They capture domain-specific variations and usage patterns for the language. In essence, profiles are domain-specific interpretations of UML, akin to domain-specific languages defined by extending or restricting UML.

Designers can define their profiles, but several UML profiles are standardized and widely used. Examples include well-known profiles that became standards in OMG (mentioned in Chapter 4 without highlighting they were UML profiles).

* UML Testing Profile (UTP): A UML profile that extends UML to support designing, visualizing, specifying, analyzing, constructing, and documenting testing artifacts.

* OMG Systems Modeling Language (SysML).

* Service-oriented architecture Modeling Language (SoaML).

* UML profile for a System on a Chip (SoCP).

* UML Profile for Schedulability, Performance, and Time.

* UML Profile for Modeling and Analyzing Real-time and Embedded Systems (MARTE).

The complete list is available online on the OMG website.
