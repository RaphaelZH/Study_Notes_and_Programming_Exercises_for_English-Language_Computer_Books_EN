### 6.4.3 BEHAVIOR DIAGRAMS (OR DYNAMIC DIAGRAMS)

*Behavior diagrams* describe system events and interactions. Different diagrams describe dynamic aspects, some equivalent in information. Designers choose graphical notation based on prominent aspects. Behavioral models with these diagrams usually describe a single or few system features and their dynamic interactions. The behavioral diagrams are the following:

* *Use case diagram*: Describes a system’s functionality in terms of external actors, their goals, and dependencies. They help understand the system’s boundaries and clarify usage scenarios. They’re particularly relevant in the requirement specification phase and early
design phase.

* *Activity diagram*: Describes the step-by-step workflows of activities to reach a goal. It shows the overall flow of data and control through an oriented graph, with nodes representing the *activities*.

* *State machine diagram (or statechart)*: Describes the states and state transitions of a system, subsystem, or object. They’re suitable for describing event-driven, discrete behavior, but not continuous behavior. In statecharts, nodes represent states (not actions), unlike in activity diagrams.

* *Interaction diagrams*: A subset of behavior diagrams focus on the flow of control and data among system elements. They include the following diagrams.

	1. *Sequence diagram*: Shows how objects communicate through a temporal sequence of messages. Messages are sequenced vertically on a timeline, and the lifespan of associated objects is reported. Interaction diagrams describe system execution scenarios.

	2. *Communication or collaboration diagram*: Shows the interactions between objects or classes using solid, undirected lines connecting elements that can interact. Messages flow through these links. Sequencing information is obtained by numbering messages. They describe both some static structure (links and nodes) and dynamic behavior (messages) of the system, combining information from class, sequence, and use case diagrams. 

	3. *Interaction overview diagram*: Shows interaction diagrams represented by nodes.

	4. *Timing diagrams*: Interaction diagrams that focus on timing constraints.
