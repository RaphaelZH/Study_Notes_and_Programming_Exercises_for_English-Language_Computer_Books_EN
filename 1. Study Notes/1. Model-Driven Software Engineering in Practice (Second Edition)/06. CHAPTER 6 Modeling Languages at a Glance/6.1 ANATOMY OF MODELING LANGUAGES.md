## 6.1 ANATOMY OF MODELING LANGUAGES

A modeling language is defined by three core ingredients:

* *Abstract syntax*: Describes the language’s structure and how primitives can be combined, regardless of representation.

* *Concrete syntax*: Describes specific representations, including encoding and visual appearance. It can be textual or graphical and is a reference for designers during modeling.

* *Semantics*: Describes the meaning of language elements and combinations.

Modeling languages require three mandatory ingredients: semantics, abstract syntax, and concrete syntax. Figure 6.1 illustrates their relationships. Semantics defines abstract syntax, which indirectly defines concrete syntax; the concrete syntax represents the abstract syntax.

This applies to both general-purpose languages (GPLs) and domain-specific ones (DSLs). Unfortunately, language designers and users often neglect aspects, especially semantics. This is likely due to the concrete syntax’s visibility, representing the actual notation used in everyday applications.

However, defining a language without fully specifying its conceptual elements and meanings is illogical. A partial or incorrect semantics leads to incorrect language usage, misunderstandings, and differing interpretations of concepts and models. This can cause confusion and errors.

Modeling languages describe the real world at a specific level of abstraction and from a particular perspective. Their semantics, which aims to describe this in detail, enables correct language usage. Semantics can be defined as:

* *Denotational*: Defining the meaning of concepts, properties, relationships, and constraints through mathematical expressions.

* *Operational*: Defining the language’s meaning by implementing an interpreter that directly defines model behavior.

* *Translational*: Mapping language concepts to another language with clearly defined semantics.
