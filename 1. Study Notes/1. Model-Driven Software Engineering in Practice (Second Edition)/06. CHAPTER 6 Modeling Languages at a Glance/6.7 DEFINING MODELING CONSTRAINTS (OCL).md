## 6.7 DEFINING MODELING CONSTRAINTS (OCL)

Modeling and metamodeling languages are usually small, with limited constructs for defining new languages.

This facilitates their practical use (learning curve is not steep since language designers don’t need to learn many concepts), but it has a price. Metamodeling languages can only express a limited subset of relevant information for defining a modeling language. They only support defining basic modeling constraints, such as cardinality constraints that restrict possible links between modeling elements.

Object Constraint Language (OCL) is a general-purpose, textual formal language adopted as a standard by the OMG. It’s a *typed*, *declarative*, and *side effect-free* *specification* language. Each OCL expression has a type, evaluates to a value of that type, and must conform to its rules and operations. OCL expressions can query or constrain the system’s state but not modify it. It doesn’t include imperative constructs and doesn’t include implementation details or guidelines.

OCL complements metamodels with textual rules that models conforming to them must follow. These rules, known as well-formedness rules when applied to a metamodel, define the set of well-formed models that can be specified with that specific modeling language.

OCL constraints are invariants defined in a specific type’s context. Their condition must be satisfied by all instances of the *context type*. The standard OCL library defines primitive and collection types, along with their operations. Quantifiers (like for *all* and *exists*) and other iterators (*select*, *reject*, *closure*, etc.) are also available. Access to object properties and navigation to related objects is done using the dot notation.
