## 6.5 UML EXTENSIBILITY: THE MIDDLE WAY BETWEEN GPL AND DSL

If the development requires unusual modeling, consider using a domain-specific language. Instead of a new DSL, extend the existing GPL as an intermediate solution to fit the needs. For example, we show UML’s extensibility features.

UML offers various extension features: stereotypes, constraints, tagged values, and profiles. The *Profile diagram*, focusing on language extensibility, shows stereotypes as classes and profiles as packages at the metamodel level. The extension relationship indicates the metamodel element a stereotype extends. This section provides an overview of these extensibility options.
