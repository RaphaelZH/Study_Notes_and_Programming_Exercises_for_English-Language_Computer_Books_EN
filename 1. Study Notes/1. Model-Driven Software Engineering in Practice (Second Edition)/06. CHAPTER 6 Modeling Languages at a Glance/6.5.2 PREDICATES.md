### 6.5.2 PREDICATES

Another way to vary UML semantics is to use *restriction predicates* (e.g., OCL expressions) that reduce semantic variation of modeling elements. Predicates can be attached to any UML meta-class or stereotype and can be formal or informal expressions. To be coherent with UML symbols, expressions must not contradict the inherited base semantics of elements.
