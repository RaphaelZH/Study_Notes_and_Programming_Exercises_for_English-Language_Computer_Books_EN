## 6.3 GENERAL-PURPOSE VS. DOMAIN-SPECIFIC MODELING LANGUAGES

As mentioned in Chapter 1, modeling languages are classified as domain-specific or general-purpose.

*Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs, or DSLs for short)* are languages designed for specific domains, contexts, or companies to support people describing things in those domains.

*General-Purpose Modeling Languages (GPMLs, or GMLs/GPLs)* are modeling notations applicable to any sector or domain.

However, this distinction is not so deterministic and well-defined. Deciding whether a language is a DSL or GPL is not a binary choice. For instance, UML and similar languages seem to belong to the latter group, since they can model any domain. However, if we consider modeling in general, UML is a DSL tailored to the specification of (mainly object-oriented) software systems.

The decision on whether to use UML (or any other GPL) or a DSL for a modeling project is significant. While UML may not be the best option for certain domains (like user interaction design), a domain-specific language tailored to that domain can produce better results. However, discussing DSL vs. UML without acknowledging UML’s many-domains language (MDL) nature is misleading. UML may not be suitable for all domains, but it can be easily applied to model many of them successfully.

UML may have flaws, but we’re aware of them. Creating an unnecessary DSL may repeat UML’s mistakes. Avoid reinventing the wheel. If your DSL resembles UML, consider using a subset of UML and avoiding new "almost-UML" notations.

On the theoretical side, concerning GPLs, one may wonder if a language to be a GPL must also be Turing-complete. If not, it means it’s not truly "general," since it can’t solve every problem. However, this interpretation is rarely considered, and the definition of a language as GPL or DSL is more a matter of practice or subjectivity. Martin Fowler clarifies that even deciding whether a set of concepts (or operations) is a language or just a set of operations within another language is a matter of perspective.
