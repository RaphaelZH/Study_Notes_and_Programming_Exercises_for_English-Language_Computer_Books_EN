### 6.5.3 TAGGED VALUES

*Tagged values* consist of a tag-value pair that can be attached as a typed property to a stereotype. They allow designers to specify additional information useful for implementing, transforming, or executing a model, such as defining project management data. For example, a tagged value "status = unit_tested" can declare that a component has gone through the unit testing phase.
