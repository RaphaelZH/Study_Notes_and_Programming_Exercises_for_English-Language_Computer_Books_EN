## 6.6 OVERVIEW ON DSLS

Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs), also known as Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), are designed to address the needs of a specific application domain. They are tailored to the domain’s requirements, both in terms of expressive power and notation, making them particularly useful.

DSLs don’t force users to learn more general-purpose languages with irrelevant concepts. Instead, they provide appropriate modeling abstractions and primitives closer to the domain.
