### 6.5.1 STEREOTYPES

Stereotypes extend meta-classes by defining additional semantics for their concept. A model element can be stereotyped multiple ways. To define a stereotype, specify the following properties:

* *Base metaclasses*, defining the elements to be extended.

* *Constraints*, defining the special rules and semantics that apply to this specialization, characterizing the stereotype in terms of semantics.

* *Tagging values*, defining zero or more values the stereotype may need for proper functioning.

* *Icon*, defining the visual appearance of stereotyped elements in the diagrams.

One doubt may arise: why not use standard sub-classing instead of stereotyping? Subclassing defines a special relation between items in the same model, while stereotypes define new modeling concepts used to create models. Stereotypes are typically used to define (i) additional semantic constraints, (ii) additional semantics outside UML’s scope (e.g., metadata for code generators), or (iii) new modeling concepts with specific behavior or properties that will often be reused.
