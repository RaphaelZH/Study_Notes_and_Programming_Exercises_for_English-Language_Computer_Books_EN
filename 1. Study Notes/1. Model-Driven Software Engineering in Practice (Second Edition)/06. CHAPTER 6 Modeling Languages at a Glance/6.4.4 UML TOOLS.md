### 6.4.4 UML TOOLS

Given UML’s popularity, many UML modeling tools are available. They’re easily distinguishable from other MDD tools because they focus solely on UML design, with limited support for various MDE scenarios. For instance, they differ from metamodeling tools, which focus on designing new modeling languages.

UML tools create UML models, import/export them in XMI format, and sometimes provide partial code generation. The market offers various UML tool licenses, from open source to freeware to commercial. Wikipedia has a comprehensive list of UML tools with their main features.
