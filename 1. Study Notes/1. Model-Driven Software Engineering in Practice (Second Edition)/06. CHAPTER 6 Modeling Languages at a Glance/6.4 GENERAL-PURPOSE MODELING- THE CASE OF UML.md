## 6.4 GENERAL-PURPOSE MODELING: THE CASE OF UML

This section provides an overview of the *Unified Modeling Language (UML)*. UML is widely known and adopted, making it an interesting example for discussing general characteristics of modeling languages. It’s a full-fledged language suite with various diagrams for describing a system from different perspectives. Figure 6.2 shows the taxonomy of UML diagrams, with 7 for static aspects and 7 for dynamic aspects. As shown in Figure 6.3, some diagrams describe class characteristics, while others describe instance features and behavior. Some diagrams can describe both levels.

UML is a modeling language that doesn’t enforce a specific development method. It’s often mentioned with the Unified Process (UP), particularly its specialization, Rational Unified Process (RUP). RUP is an iterative software development process framework created by Rational Software Corporation (now IBM). While RUP and UML work well together, adopting RUP isn’t necessary for using UML.

UML, a unifying language for software modeling, has a long history of merges and restructuring. Some pieces, like Harel’s statecharts and Booch’s notations, date back to the mid-1980s when various notations existed. The first version of UML emerged in 1996 from the fusion of Booch, Rumbaugh, and Jacobson’s approaches. Discussed at OOPSLA, it was submitted to OMG in August 1997 and released as UML 1.1 in November 1997. Despite criticisms, UML remains a complex and inconsistent language, yet remains a crucial tool for software modeling.
