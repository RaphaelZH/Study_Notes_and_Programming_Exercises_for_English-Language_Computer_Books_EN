### 6.6.2 CLASSIFICATION OF DSLS

DSLs can be classified based on focus, style, notation, internality, and execution.

**Focus**

DSLs can be vertical or horizontal. Vertical DSLs target specific industries or fields, like configuration languages for home automation, modeling languages for biological experiments, and analysis languages for financial applications. Horizontal DSLs have broader applicability and can apply to many applications. Examples include SQL, Flex, IFML, WebML, and more.

**Style**

DSLs can be declarative or imperative. Declarative DSLs express computation logic without describing control flow. They define what a program should accomplish, not how. Service choreography is a typical declarative definition, defining Web service coupling rules. Imperative DSLs require defining an executable algorithm with steps and control flow to complete a job. Service orchestration is a typical imperative definition, defining a start-to-end flow of execution between Web services.

**Notation**

DSLs can be graphical or textual. Graphical DSLs use visual models and graphical development primitives like blocks, arrows, edges, containers, and symbols. Textual DSLs include XML-based notations, structured text notations, and textual configuration files.

**Internality**

External DSLs, as defined by Martin Fowler, have their own custom syntax. You can write a full parser for them and use them to create self-standing, independent models and programs.

Internal DSLs extend a host language to mimic a specific domain or objective. This can be achieved by embedding DSL pieces in the host language or providing abstractions, structures, or functions. Embedding allows reuse of host language tools and facilities.

**Execution**

Executability can be implemented through model interpretation (reading and executing DSL scripts at runtime) or code generation (applying a complete model-to-text (M2T) transformation at deployment time).
