### 6.4.1 DESIGN PRACTICES

UML facilitates system design and promotes good design practices. It offers several features:

* Integrated and orthogonal models: UML’s diagrams share symbols and allow cross-referencing between modeling artifacts.

* Modeling at different levels of detail: UML allows designers to choose the right amount of information to include in diagrams based on the purpose and phase of development.

* Extensibility: UML provides features for designing customized modeling languages.

* Pattern-based design: UML includes well-known design patterns defined by the Gang of Four.

The following sections describe a few details about UML modeling to provide an overview of a typical GPL.
