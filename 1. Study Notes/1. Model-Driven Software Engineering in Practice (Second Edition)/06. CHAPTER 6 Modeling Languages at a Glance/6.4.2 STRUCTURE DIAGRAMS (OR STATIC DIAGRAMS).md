### 6.4.2 STRUCTURE DIAGRAMS (OR STATIC DIAGRAMS)

*Structure diagrams* describe the elements in a system being modeled. They’re used extensively in documenting software systems at two main levels.

* The system’s *conceptual items* of interest. This level of design describes the domain and system in terms of concepts and their associations. Typical diagrams describe this part.

	1. *Class diagram*: Describes a system’s structure using classes, attributes, and relationships. Classes can be described at different levels of detail.

	2. *Composite structure diagram*: Describes the internal structure of a class and its collaborations. They use a syntax similar to class diagrams but exploit containment and connections between items. The core concepts are *parts* (i.e., roles played at runtime by instances), *ports* (i.e., interaction points connecting classifiers), and *connectors* (undirected edges connecting entities through ports).

	3. *Object diagram*: A view of the structure of example instances of modeled concepts at a specific point in time, possibly including property values. Similar to class diagrams, objects are identified by underlined names. They can also be identified by the tuple object name and class name, the simple object name, or the class they’re instantiated from. The respective notations are as follows:

		<ins>objectName:ClassName</ins> or <ins>objectName</ins> or <ins>:ClassName</ins>

* The *architectural representation* of the system. This level of design describes the system’s architectural organization and structure. It typically consists of reuse and deployment-oriented information, based on the conceptual modeling done in the previous step. The diagrams in this part of the design include:

	1. *Component diagram*: Describes how a software system is divided into components and their dependencies. In UML, a component is a distributable piece of implementation, including software code and other information, that implements a subsystem.

	2. *Package diagram*: Describes how a system is divided into logical groupings called packages in UML, along with their dependencies.

	3. *Deployment diagram*: Describes how software artifacts are deployed on hardware in systems’ implementations.
