### 6.6.1 PRINCIPLES OF DSLS

DSLs are essential for many application scenarios, beyond software development. Designing a DSL requires deep domain knowledge and language engineering practices. Finding the right abstractions for defining a DSL is challenging and time-consuming.

To be useful, the DSL should follow these principles:

* The language should provide good abstractions, be intuitive, and simplify development, not complicate it.

* The language should be adopted and used by everyone, and its definition should be agreed upon after some evaluation, not just by one person.

* The language must evolve and be updated based on user and context needs to avoid extinction.

* Domain experts prioritize maximizing productivity in their domains, but they’re unwilling to invest significant time in defining methods and tools. Therefore, the language must be combined with supporting tools and methods.

* A good DSL should be open for extensions but closed for modifications, following the open-close principle that "software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

Good DSLs don’t appear out of nowhere. MDSE aims to have good language designers who build suitable DSLs for the right audience. Refining a good language takes years, involving industrial experience and thousands of users. While DSL development is encouraged, careful design is essential. Defining a new DSL is not trivial and may lead to a language with weaknesses or drawbacks for future users. Tools, design interfaces, and runtime architectures should be tailored to the domain to avoid user rejection.
